NOTE:
these files are unneeded if you already have V3.45 yourself.


1. Simply rename your chosen file (ex. 3.45_patched.exe) to Growtopia.exe
2. drag it to your chosen growtopia folder (It should always be higher or equal version so textures are correct)

The files exist so you can use it for a verified version (like V3.45) if you dont happen to have that version.

The patched version is recommended, as you only need to drag INZERNAL.dll into the same directory.
Alternatively you can use the injector with either unmodified or patched version.
You can inject and deinject multiple times with no worry.

V3.45_patched: 		used patcher.exe
V3.45_unmodified: 	stock version
